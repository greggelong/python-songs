# python-songs
a repo to hold some python songs
These originated with the prompt from a friend:

My python songs are in the code as .py files

My friend's python songs are in the email below.

Hey Greg,

So I figured you'd appreciate this.  This SANS instructor, Mark Baggett, plays a game at the beginning of his lecture here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRsj3vBT1xk&t=1213s

He shows some python code and you have to guess the song it represents.

I did my own take on that but with Christmas songs.  

1) 
for year in history:
    if santa not in year:
        print(year)

2) 
while walls = 0 and temp < 32:
    person['age'] == 1:
    exclamation(person, temp, walls)

3) 
if day = datetime(year=datetime.now(),month=12,day=25)
    my_loc = "qwertyuiopasdfjkl;zxcvnm,."[10:18] 

4) 
for x in range(0,3):
    print(' *'*60 +'\n' + '* '*60 + '\n' +' *'*60)

Can you guess the songs?
